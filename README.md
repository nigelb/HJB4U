HJB4U - HyperJAXB 4 Users
=========================

HJB4U is a toolchain for the creation of a HyperJAXB front end database users. 
It was created because we had a number of databases users that had to convert 
there data into XML for govenment reporting purposes. Unfortunantly the schema
was constantly evolving, with monthly updates over the course of a year(s). I 
simply didn't have the time to tweak the code every time they decided to update
the schema, so HJB4U was born.
